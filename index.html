<p>I love color! I think using color...all kinds of colors...can be one a most beautiful and intelligent way to communicate. So when it came to designing a color-based remote and user interface, this installation by Elena Manferdini inspired me for this project.</p>

<p>The TV remote was created by Zenith in 1950, and so the couch potato was born. Since then, not much has changed: we still have couch potatoes pushing buttons on a rectangular object to get from visual point A-to-B. However, Zenith got it right the first time. The <em>Zenith Three Hundred Space Commander</em> was kinda sleek and cool for an early model. It reflected a time of innovation, sci-fi films and abstract expressionism.</p>

  <p>This week I needed some tips on the basics. So, I checked out a few books from Decker Library on stuff like prototyping, infographics, font, color, design, etc. These will come in handy for my presentation. The visuals are great. I enjoy thumbing through <em>Unfolding the Napkin, </em>especially for clarity on explaining the<em> how </em>of the user interface design. </p>

  <p>In preparation for my first presentation, I'm researching a few current models. I never realized how ugly and bulky TV remotes are until this project. Add their monotone black or grey and they're quite masculine. The only aesthetic is the hourglass shape (for easier hold) which you'd think would make it a bit feminine -- but it doesn't. All of the current models look alike: chocked full of buttons - 90% of which never get used. As a matter of fact, after doing a little research, I discovered that users' eyes primarily rest on a single area: up &amp; down, right &amp; left buttons. Considering most households have numerous remotes (1 for the TV, 1 for the DVR, 1 for cable, 1 for &nbsp;the Xbox...blah...blah...blah), these all-in-one's are kinda pointless. I won't even mention that TiVo flip-slide thing. </p>

<p>So this week I sketched out a few ideas for what I thought a 'futuristic' remote would look like. Definitely need to work on my sketching skills. I didn't know until afterward that pretty much the first series of models I sketched are already on the market in some way or another. what I didn't know has been on the market already. In essence these models are bulky and awkard to hold, and are still shaped list prototype. </p>

  <p>Collecting, collecting, collecting images that inspire. So I found the work of this amazing artist/engineer/designer Elena Manferdini. Atelier’s uses her architechture to also design clothes, jewelry and furniture using a laser cuttedr to cut designs in fabric, wood, metal and just about anything. Her shapes and patterns remind me of the kind of movement I want to use to reflect transition throughout and between interfaces. Her colorful installations might be perfect for the cover of my blog. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyc8Bpndyos Elena Manferdini at UIC SOA </p>

  <p>While continuing to look for textures and shapes for my interface, I stumbled upon the breathtaking architecture-kisses-ecology work of Orproject. I love their play of color and light! My favorite is Orproject’s Vana “trees” – I love the light emitted from the trees. I installed Orproject here on this page to reflect my creative mood and the movement I want to display throughout the interface design. As you can see its very similar to Elena’s work. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>These courtyard trees show how bright colors can be not only non-offensive but actually pleasing to the eye, which is what I want to accomplish with the design of my interface. </p>
