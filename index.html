<p>I love color! I think using color...all kinds of colors...is a beautiful, intelligent way to communicate. So when it came to designing a color-based remote and user interface, this installation by Elena Manferdini inspired me for this project.</p>

<p>The TV remote was created by Zenith in 1950, and so the couch potato was born. Since then, not much has changed: we still have couch potatoes pushing buttons on a rectangular object to get from visual point A-to-B. However, Zenith got it right the first time. The <em>Zenith Three Hundred Space Commander</em> was kinda sleek and cool for an early model. It reflected a time of innovation, sci-fi films, beatniks and abstract expressionism.</p>

  <p>This week I needed some tips on the basics. So, I checked out a few books from Decker Library on stuff like prototyping, infographics, font, color, design, etc. These will come in handy for my presentation. The visuals are great. I enjoy thumbing through <em>Unfolding the Napkin, </em>especially for clarity on explaining the<em> how </em>of the user interface design. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In preparation for my first presentation, I'm researching a few current models. I never realized how ugly and bulky TV remotes are until this project. Add their monotone black or grey and they're quite masculine. The only aesthetic is the hourglass shape (for easier hold) which you'd think would make it a bit feminine -- but it doesn't. All of the current models look alike: chocked full of buttons - 90% of which never get used. As a matter of fact, after doing a little research, I discovered that users' eyes primarily rest on a single area: up &amp; down, right &amp; left buttons. Considering most households have numerous remotes (1 for the TV, 1 for the DVR, 1 for cable, 1 for &nbsp;the Xbox...blah...blah...blah), these all-in-one's are kinda pointless. I won't even mention that TiVo flip-slide thing. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this week I sketched out a few ideas for what I thought a 'futuristic' remote might look like. <em>Definitely need to work on my sketching. </em>Though I think a rectangular shape is best (easy grip, fit more buttons, hold for extended time)<em>, </em>I'm drawn to the circular shape in the first set of sketches. </p>
<p>I then reworked it on a white board. I imagine a touch pad in the center, and thought of contrasting a circular pad onto a square device. If circular, the finger motion would be like a 'swirl.' So I drew that, and ultimately just drew the circle by itself with a swirl. </p>
<p>I like the swirl, but think it may be oversimplified for users, so I flipped it to put all the buttons on the other side. Users have the option of using the remote either way: swirl or buttons. </p>

<p>I feel like Dorothy when she walks out of the house for the first time into Munchkin land. After much time in black &amp; white sketches, I finally get to add color! </p>

<p>So, the squares on this rainbow waffle remind me of buttons I sketched on the device. But do I want that many buttons? &nbsp;Well, the circular shape and colors are most inpsirational. Now all I need is a little maple syrup...</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/yellowbrickroadstarting.jpg" width="440" height="330" alt=""/>

<p> Seems like I see a swirl wherever I go. Here's a classic swirl design.....follow the yellow-brick road! </p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/mockup2.jpg" width="436" height="246" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>Here's my first prototype. It was easy to make: brown paper bag, 2 plastic tupperware container tops, tape and markers. Unfortunately, it's too wide. I had a few people try it out and both women and men found it difficult to reach their thumb around, stretching across the face of the swirl touch pad. Back to the drawing board...</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/me3dprinting.jpg" width="300" height="353" alt=""/>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Though I've got a final exam in a few hours, nothing can stifle the excitement I have for my first 3D print job! &nbsp;With Ryan's help, we ran a first model which failed because the heat was too high, then too low. After resetting, and adjusting the base so the object wouldn't fall, we were on our way. We could smell the "pancake" scent as the machine ran, and next thing you know...<em>voila! </em></p>
<p>Since the first prototype was too large, I Googled sizes of mini CD disks, calculated their size in millimeters, entered those into Rhino and rescaled the remote for printing. </p>

<p>Collecting images that inspire. So, I found the work of this amazing artist/engineer/designer Elena Manferdini. Elena also uses laser cutters to design clothes, jewelry and furniture. Her shapes and patterns remind me of the kind of movement I want to use to reflect transition throughout and between interfaces. Hmmm...one of her colorful installations might be perfect for the header of my index page on my blog. </p>

<p>While continuing to look for textures and shapes for my interface, I stumbled upon the breathtaking architecture-kisses-ecology work of Orproject. I love their play of color and light! My favorite are &nbsp;their light-emitting "trees." </p>
